Click on the button "Show stops from MIT to Harvard" to start the bus that stops at each of the bus stations between MIT and Harvard.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
Potential future improvements include a more sophisticated tracker with more stops, multiple trackers running parellelly, and a customization feature for users to use their own API.
