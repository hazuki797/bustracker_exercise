The real-time bus tracker assignment was modified into a Disneyland Railroad Tracker, that shows the train looping through the 4 railroad stops within Disneyland. This project showcases the use of Mapbox API in integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic experience for the user.

<h2>How to run:</h2> 
Click on the button "Disneyland Railroad Stops" to start the train that stops at 4 stations. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
Potential future improvements include a more sophisticated tracker with more stops, multiple trackers running parellelly, and a customization feature for users to use their own API.
